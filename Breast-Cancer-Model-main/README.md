# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Developed as part of the Machine Learning Core Concepts and Application Course

The machine learning project we have made is based on the "Breast Cancer Dataset" and it aims to develop a predictive model that can help identify individuals whose tumor parameters suggest malignant or benign cancer. The project involves using advanced machine learning techniques such as classification algorithms to analyze the dataset's various parameters and predict the likelihood of breast cancer in patients. By doing so, the project aims to provide healthcare professionals with a tool that can help them diagnose cancer at an early stage and provide timely treatment, improving patient outcomes.
